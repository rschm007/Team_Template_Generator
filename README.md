## Description
---
A CLI application that prompts the user for information about the team manager and then the team members. After going through inquirer prompts (and passing the validation tests), the app will create a HTML file that dynamically inserts each team member's information into cards. The HTML page is mobile responsive thanks to Flexbox.

# Installation

For installation you will need to use node.js to type npm install in your CLI. This app uses inquirer, path, fs, and tailwindcss packages.


# Usage
---
To initialize the app, open your terminal in the project's root directory and type "node app.js". The app will then use the inquirer package to walk you through a series of prompts. Once you are satisfied with your team build, the app will generate your custom HTML file in the "output" directory
